radiosondy.info weather balloon flight data visualization - Excel VBA macro

# Introduction
I started this project to get first insights into Excel VBA. Some 'real life data' and a target to achieve are always a good propulsion â€“ so I started to build a workbook to visualize weather balloon flight data. 
For sure, it is not a masterpiece in coding, but for beginners in data analysis it is a good starting point. The charts generated in the workbook may not be that fancy but give you already a better idea about what is going on up in the air.

As a source, the workbook is dealing with archived data from the site radiosondy.info. This site is showing crowd collected data from weather balloons up in the air. 
The tool pulls apart the text strings of the recorded balloon data, does some juggling and formatting tricks and finally prints some charts.

The post-processed data could been used as input for other tools, models or coding projects, like any sort of flight or weather prediction. The charts might be good for your projects or presentations.

I tested the macro with hundreds of flights. Most of the time it worked fine, but sometimes errors came up especially when generating the charts. Excel occasionally struggles to copy named objects. A second try usually works. Just download the Excel file, get an idea how it works, feel free to improve and adjust the macro or the charts to suite your needs.

Have fun!
